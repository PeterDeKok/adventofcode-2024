# Ideas

## Considering:
- Second list for parts
- Keymap `d` for download
- Keymap `t` for test run (per part -> samples)
- Keymap `r` for real run
- Automate submit?
    - commit format: solution(day1:part1:sub1): Historian Hysteria
- Git add & commit puzzle part
- Leaderboard page
- viewport: maybe recognize separator rows and re-render a new table to separate the borders?
- Allow the executable to run individual management tasks by providing arguments
- solution#RunSample (& RunInput) runlogger listener?
- Ensure done is called always (defer runnig--)
- Open Editor (i.e. Fleet at the right file and project (because tools!!))
- Add hotkeys to questions component answers

## TODO
- Show status of day/part -> Get from leaderboard json??
- Parse problem, sample(s) from site
- Create util functions -> continue
- Add all env variables to README
- go vet?
- Double check star/solution times!!!!
- Ensure fun lines can be updated
    - Should it be automated after OK input run?
- As stats is removed from git, make sure the README is actually updated!
